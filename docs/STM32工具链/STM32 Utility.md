It provides an easy-to-use and efficient environment for reading, writing and verifying a memory device.
The tool offers a wide range of features to program STM32 internal memories (Flash, RAM, OTP and others), external memories, to verify the programming content (checksum, verify during and after programming, compare with file) and to automate STM32 programming.
STM32 ST-LINK Utility is delivered as a graphical user interface (GUI) with a command line interface (CLI).
